## Procedure

In this experiment we will learn about cmos inverter circuit 

Steps are 

- > First select pmos component from the toolbar  and drag it into the worksapce 
- > Similarly drag all the required components (nmos , input , output , ground and volt) for simulating the experiment 
- > Connect volt to first terminal of pmos to volt by dragging volts endpoint(circle in black )to pmos upper terminal
- > Similarly connect ground to nmos 
- > Connect input to pmos's and nmos's middle terminal 
- > Connect third terminal of both  pmos's and nmos's to ouput 
- > Now check if all six connections are made
- > Click on simulate button and see the graph
